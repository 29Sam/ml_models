linear regrssionm - simplest model that tries to find the relation betwwen x and y linearly 
y=kx+b - by just knowing x , pu will be able to know the 'y'
use any k and any b and generate lines and then  compare the sqaured error , pick that pair that gives the least sqaued error summed up

polynomial regression 
y=w1 x^3 +w2 x^2 +w3 x + b
the idea is to catch even the non linear relationshoipns between x and y
maximum degree of the polynomail to be used is manually provied by us .

some regularization techniques - ridge , lasso and elastic net 
1)ridge - some coeffcients shrink 'towards' zero giving less impact on prdiction 
2)lasso - feature selection
3)elestic net - uses both ridge and lasso
